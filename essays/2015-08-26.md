Fear is very useful to us as humans. It is a vital response to physical and emotional danger — if we didn’t feel it, we couldn’t protect ourselves from legitimate threats. But often we fear situations that are far from dangerous and these fears can stop us from experiencing wonderful things such as improved hearing.
We as humans are hardwired for self preservation. That familiar adrenaline surge, or “fight or flight” response, kicks in when we sense a threat to our life or well being. But now we have moved on from the law of the jungle, fear forces us to focus on areas of our lives which our instincts tell us needs our attention, be it a problem in the workplace, a bad relationship or perhaps a hearing problem which needs to be addressed. Fear forces us into extreme concentration and helps us to shed distractions. Scientists have also proven that fear can give us so-called “super powers”, for example the ability to lift heavy objects when under extreme pressure. Penn State kinesiologist Vladimir Zatsiorsky found that in competition scenarios weight lifters can lift an additional 12% because in critical situations, where there is a potential benefit (a world championship title, for example), your subconscious brain thinks the benefit is worth risking an injury.
Researchers have shown that a positive mindset goes a long way in helping us to overcome our fears. In the case of those with a fear of flying, it helps if these people are looking forward to what greets them at the end of the journey.
We gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. We must do the thing which you think you cannot do. So don’t let fear steal your funk.
